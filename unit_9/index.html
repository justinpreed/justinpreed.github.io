					<h2>Musician</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>
						JP Reed is singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Justin Reed. Growing up in Escalon, CA and Newark, CA, Reed developed his appreciation of music at an early age. After spending the late 1990s and 2000s fronting and playing guitar in a series of loud rock bands, Reed turned off his amplifier and picked up his acoustic guitar. Stripped down to the dynamics of acoustic instruments and foot percussion, Reed focused on song craft and the discovered the power of emotional expression through simplicity. The result is Reed's 2014 debut full-length, "Foreboding Joy;" a diary of powerful songs which showcase his songwriting strengths and imaginative arrangements.</p>

					<p>
						Only 1 short year later, Reed released his second album "Steeped in These Storms". Moving away from the simple drums on his debut album, he incorporated a full wall of sound. The opening song "Someone to Love" will tickle your ears forcing your toes to start tapping. This album is filled with his own brand of love songs, including "Still" and "Skinny Jeans". Both self-deprecating and romantic. "Steeped in These Storms" ends with a powerful baritone song "Keen + Bitter". This track will make you questioning what all the previous songs stood for and will leave you wondering what will happen next. This album is filled with surprise endings and secrets. Enjoy!</p>
					<p>
						Reed is now recording his third album "Hiraeth". Scheduled to release early 2017. Stay tuned!</p>
